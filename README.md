# CFNP's Project Serve App

**Note: This app is meant for internal use at SST Singapore (for now) and we are currently working on Version 2.**

This app is designed to supplement the Scouts' Logistics IC and helps keep track of inventory. As of writing (1 September), the app includes these features:

* Adding items
* Displaying quantity of items, alongside an image
* Connects to Google Sheets and Firebase
* Note taking
* More to come...
