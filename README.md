# CFNP's Project Serve App

**Note: This app is meant for internal use at SST Singapore (for now) and is currently in the early stages of development.**

This app is designed to supplement the Scouts' Logistics IC and helps keep track of inventory. As of writing (14 July), the app includes these features:

* Adding items
* Displaying quantity of items, alongside an image
* Connects to google sheets
* More to come... (hopefully)
